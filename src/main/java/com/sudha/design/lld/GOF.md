`Creational patterns involve object instantiation and all provide a way to decouple client from objects to instantiate`

* `Singleton`
* `AbstractFactory`
* `Factory`
* `Prototype`
* `Builder`

`Structural patterns lets you compose classes or objects into larger structures`

* `Decorator`
* `Adapter`
* `Proxy`
* `Facade`
* `Composite`
* `Flyweight`
* `Bridge`

`Behavioural patterns are concerned with how classes and object interact to distribute responsibility`

* `Strategy`
* `Command`
* `Iterator`
* `Template`
* `Observer`
* `State`
* `Interpreter`
* `Visitor`
* `Memento`
* `Mediator`
* `Chain of responsibility`

`Class patterns describe how relationships between classes are defined via inheritance, relationships can be established
at compile time`

* `Factory`
* `Template`
* `Adapter`
* `Interpreter`

`Object Patterns describe relationships between objects and are primarily defined by composition. Relationships in 
object patterns are typically created at runtime and are more dynamic and flexible.`

* `remaining all patterns`

```
An anti-pattern tells you how to go from a problem to a bad solution
```

- `It tells you why a bad solution is attractive`
- `It tells you why a solution is bad in the long term`
- `It suggests other applicable patterns which may provide good solutions`
